# HY rwd mobile guide

Built with

* [yeoman](http://yeoman.io) [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp)
	* [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)
  	* [sass-bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
	* [jquery](http://jquery.com)
  	* [modernizr](http://modernizr.com)
* external dependencies
	* [compass-flexbox](https://github.com/timhettler/compass-flexbox)

The web pages are built with Bootstrap 3 grid and components and don't contain any written javascript at the momentâ€”just HTML and CSS. Thus these pages won't work on older browsers that don't support, e.g. css flexbox. That's where Javascript will prove useful.

	4. clone project repository `git clone git@code.futurice.com:hy_mobiiliohjeistus.git`
	5. go to project root directory `cd hy_mobiiliohjeistus`
2. Install development environment
	1. install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.org) (with homebrew)

## Project dependencies

This project has three different dependencies

* npm dependencies in package.json
  * add new npm dependency by `npm install packagename --save-dev` 
  --save-dev adds packagename and version to package.json
  * after committing/pushing the changes to git, others will have to run `npm install`  
  after they have pulled the changes to install updated/added versions of the dependencies to their local machine
* bower dependencies in bower.json
  * add new bower dependency by `bower install packagename --save`  
  --save adds packagename and version to bower.json
  * after committing/pushing the changes to git, others will have to run `bower install`  
  after they have pulled the changes to install updated/added versions of the dependencies to their local machine
* compass dependencies in Gruntfile.js compass:options:require
  * install new compass dependency from gem
  * add new compass dependency to Gruntfile.js
  * after committing/pushing the changes to git, others will have to install the required compass dependencies from gem to their local machine after they have pulled the changes


## Development

All the development happens in __app__ directory

You should not make changes to __dist__ directory, because each `grunt build` will overwrite the changes. The files contain also all the css and js from bower dependencies, e.g. __bootstrap css and js__ which you shouldn't touch.


## Deployment

1. Build project
	* in project root directory `grunt build`
	* grunt will create new folder __dist__ that contains the published project
	* you can also test the built project with `grunt serve:dist` (will also build the project)
2. Move contents of the dist directory to a web server
